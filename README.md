The purpose of this final project to the IBM Data Science Professional course pathway was to identify trends in historical SpaceX launch data to predict future landing outcomes of launches from a simulated new company, SpaceY.
The goal of this project was to retrieve SpaceX launch data using API get requests/web scraping, assign a numeric “class” to successful and failed launches, understand which variables were good predictors of landing success, produce compelling and interactive visuals to display the data, and to train an optimized classification machine learning model that would be useful in configuring future launches by new company, SpaceY.
